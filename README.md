Simple-Cone-Search-Creator
==========================

Simple Cone Search Creator (SCSC) aims at providing a very easy way to set up a Cone Search service, complying with the IVOA standard described at http://www.ivoa.net/documents/REC/DAL/ConeSearch-20080222.html

Requirements are minimal on the server side: you'll only need an HTTP server able to execute CGI scripts (no database, no Tomcat needed).

SCSC is made of 2 parts :

- an ingestor
- a CGI Python script
